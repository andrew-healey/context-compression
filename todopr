- ok! let's implement mup!

- add coord checking.
  - I think I need to add a config param to my train.py
  - And then add identity wrappers for my qkv and attn scores
  - And then let myself read from them
  - And then compute L1 for them
  - And then plot it
  - Hrrm is this easier if I just use an MLP for my model at first?
    - Let's consider. Hrrrrrrrrrrrm seems much easier to debug...
    - But I don't have exact transformer reference code, and I don't have an existing _init_weights or configure_optimizers()...
    - Hrrm maybe let's try to straight-shot our way to a working transformer implementation, OK? No MLP in between


  - Hrrm but I also then need to functionalize my train loop, right?
  - And assert no DDP. That just makes life complicated.
  - Maybe I just inherently need to functionalize it though. Now might be the time
  - Hrrm. OK let's do it. And I will just return a special kind of result in the case of coord checking.
  - OK. Then that train function will return data, OK?
    - And then in a notebook, we will run our scaling function to scale up/down with width
    - And THIS will print our beautiful coord checks.
  - OK let's read one more time how he suggests impl'ing coord checking.
    - OK so he provides get_coord_data functions 
      - They require a Torch dataloader that outputs huggingface-style dicts
      - So I should just add like a config var to my model or smth, right?
        - i.e. hf_style_inputs
      - He wants me to use his crossentropy function. How about no??
        - Ah great I'm acc fine, b/c of dict_in_out.
      - He will listen in on all my forward hooks
        - I can filter out unwanted ones if I like
        - I'll prob just disable all my crazy selection experiments for this, so don't need to do crazy filtering, IDT
  
  - Oh in this case, I don't need a custom train() function
  - I just need a make_dataloader function and a get_lazy_model function
    - And can I just safely ignore inits and stuff?
    - Hrrm so I'll be using my own optimizers, not MuAdam etc.
    - And I won't be doing any custom init
    - I *think* the mup coord checking code doesn't require me to have *any* mup things inside my network. Great.
    - OK so I'll actually do some very notebook-centric development here.

- OK! so we have coord checking, and the coords explode.
  - Now let's apply the diffs to my repo.
  - Now let's coordcheck it!
